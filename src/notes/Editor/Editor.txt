All the objects have these variables:

Selected: If they are selected, this variable is equal to one and we can perform transformations to it

Group: The group this object belongs to, useful when using triggers

Col: There will be a variable like `global.col[256]' for every level. `col' represents the index this object if part of, for example, `image_blend = global.col[col]'

Type: This is only for displaying this object in the UI, for example, the way objects will be added to the solids section, for example, will be this:
  We will have an starting index `obj_wall', objects that are added after this one, will be usable in the editor, that's why objects like the `obj_ground' and
  `obj_ground2' MUST be before that object.
  
  But... How do we know that object is a solid and not a spike, for example, so simple, with the help of type, it can have the following values:
  
  - 0: Means the object is solid
  - 1: Means the object is trap
  - 2: Means the object is special
  - 3: Means the object is purely decoration
  
Notes
=====

Don't forget to check for `obj_ground' and `obj_ground2', those objects CANNOT be modified in any way
