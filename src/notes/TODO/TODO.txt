Player experience background fill

  global.col basically, so we can store and restore user defined colours. Also, in the create event of all the objects whose colour can be changed, set
  its image blend to `global.col [col]'.
  
When changing an object's colour (using global.col), do `image_blend = global.col [col]' as well.

  Create a new table in the db `bonus_claim', that table is dropped every 24 hours, and if the player is not there, they can claim the daily bonus
  Also, there can be a column in the `users' table, that is like "bonus_progress", each time the bonus is claimed it's incremented by one, if the
  user, in the 24 hours check the server does, is not in the `bonus_claim' table - before it's dropped -, set this counter back to 1.
