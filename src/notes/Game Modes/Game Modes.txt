There are 5 game modes:

- The editor *Offline*
  What can I say? it's just a level editor.
- Community *Offline*
  There are all the levels created by the players using the editor.
- Race *Online*
  Basically, you and a group of people (that can be invited, or joined if the room is public) try to finish a level.
  The amount of rewards you get is based in the position you reached the win_wall, basically, the first ones get the most
  rewards. You can choose for random online levels with a chosen difficulty, or specify a level.
- Versus *Online*
  In this mode you can do a versus against a group of people (that can be invited, or joined if the room is public), the first one
  to complete the level wins. (or you can choose the faster in complete the level, the less attempts, the first one, etc)
- Arcade *Online*
  This mode is based in "Move or Die", basically, there are different minigames that are chosen randomly. It can involve versus, race,
  or some other world challenges. I still have to think in the minigames.
